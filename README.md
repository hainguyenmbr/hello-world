When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new readme-edits branch, which is a copy of main.

You can make and sa**ve changes to the files in your repository. On GitH**ub, saved changes are called com**mits. Each commit has an associated commit mes**sage, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.

Under the readme-edits branch you created, click the README.md file.
To edit the file, click .
In the editor, write a bit about yourself.

In the "Commit changes" box, write a commit message that describes your changes.
